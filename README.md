## Getting Started

To explore any project:

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Projects.git
   cd Projects
   ```
2. **Navigate** into the project directory of interest, for example:
   ```bash
   cd diagonal_sum_analyzer
   ```
3. **Follow that project’s** README for build, run, and usage instructions.

## Projects at a Glance

- **audio_tracking_autonomous_car/**  
  Python-driven Raspberry Pi vehicle that seeks specified audio frequencies and executes navigational maneuvers.  

- **diagonal_sum_analyzer/**  
  Performance-optimized C program using pthreads and sliding-window algorithms to compute main and secondary diagonal sums of \(n\times n\) matrices.  

- **game_show_quiz/**  
  JavaFX application presenting a geography quiz sourced from a CSV dataset, complete with scoring and persistence.  

- **snake_game/**  
  Classic console-based Snake game in C showcasing real-time input handling and game-loop design.  

- **research_assistant/**  
  Full research documentation (Summer 2025) for robotics lab work under Dr. Hongyue Sun, encapsulating code references, design rationale, and demo links.
