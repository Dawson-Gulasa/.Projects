# Summer Research Assistant Documentation

## Overview

This folder contains the comprehensive research memo that details all aspects of my summer research under Dr. Hongyue Sun in the Robotics Lab at the University of Georgia. The memo serves as a single source of truth, encapsulating:

- Project background, objectives, and methodology  
- All source code references and architecture diagrams  
- Demo video links and usage instructions  
- Analysis results, inspection reports, and metrics

## How to Use

1. Open `Research_Memo.pdf` to review the end‑to‑end documentation of the project.  
2. Follow the embedded sections for code, hardware setup, and demonstration videos.  
3. For direct access to individual scripts, datasets, and example outputs, please refer to the respective project subdirectories in the main repository (e.g., `audio_tracking_autonomous_car/`, `javafx_game_show_quiz/`, etc.).
